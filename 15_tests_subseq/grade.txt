Grading at Fri Mar  1 17:55:01 UTC 2019
I expected to find a file called 'test-subseq.c' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
grade.txt
next-README
README
run_all.sh
tests-subseq.c
tests-subseq.c~
Can't proceed without test-subseq.c

Overall Grade: FAILED
